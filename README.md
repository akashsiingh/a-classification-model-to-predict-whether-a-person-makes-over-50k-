# Naïve Bayes Classifier with Python and Scikit-Learn

In this project, I build a Naïve Bayes Classifier to predict whether a person makes over 50K in a year. I implement Naive Bayes Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn. The problem is to predict whether a person makes over 50K in a year. To answer the question, I build a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the income of the person. I have used the **census income** data set for this project, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.
